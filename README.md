# PassGenC
A simple password gen written in the C programming language. This is a CLI program, so you need to run it from your command line or terminal.

## How to Use:
- Download the executable.
- Open CMD (Windows) or Terminal (Mac & Linux).
- Drag the executable into the CMD/Terminal, click back inside it, and hit ENTER.
- The program will guide you with the rest.
- Enjoy your newly generated password!

NOTE: I have not tested on Windows yet. I will as soon as I can.
